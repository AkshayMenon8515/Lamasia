# Random Excuse Generator üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: LaMasia


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Akshay S Menon - SCMS School Of Engineering and Technology

### Project Description
The Random Excuse Generator is a fun and interactive program designed to generate unique excuses at the click of a button. Whether you're looking for a reason to explain a late submission, a last-minute change of plans, or simply want a good laugh, this project provides randomized excuses for different scenarios.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In the classic school scenario of forgetting homework, students often scramble to come up with creative excuses. Common examples include claims of family mishaps, or even miscommunications about due dates. This situation provides ample inspiration for a random excuse generator, offering humorous and relatable responses for students in need!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
To prevent forgetting homework, students should establish a consistent homework routine, use a planner or digital tools to track assignments, organize schoolwork with designated folders, communicate with teachers about potential issues, and maintain backups of digital assignments in cloud storage.
